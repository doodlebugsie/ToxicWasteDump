      <p style="text-align: center;">The purpose of this document is to provide you with the relevant information required to refute the claims made by Holocaust deniers and 
	Neo-Nazis hastily and effectively. The purveyor of this information believes it takes an incredibly long time to discredit bullshit and an
	incredibly small amount of time to create bullshit. Ideally, this will enable you to shut down any nazi you come across. It is also relevant
	to point out that much of the information present here is a "meat and potatoes" form of the information provided by expert witnesses in the
	"Irving v. Penguin Publishing ltd. and Deborah Lipstadt" case, the transcript of which you can find <a class="button-link" href="https://www.hdot.org/trial-materials/#info_DI">here</a>
	I have poured over the court transcript so that you don't have to. Below are some links to help you should you deem this document insufficient

The author of this document asks that you not spread this to those you use it against. The reason for this is that documents that are geared toward specific
argumentation that are popularized amongst the proponent for and those against it gain a reputation that emboldens those on the receiving end to
simply brush it off due to some perceived "reputation", as is often the case with the "Stinky Rightwinger Factsheet". Instead of link dumping those who oppose you, please use this
as a reference sheet and not a rhetorical cock-flop on the table. 
<br> 
<br>
It is trivialy easy to say "You can't expect me to look through 20 links/read a massive webpage/whatever in order to engage with your argument". 
It is much more difficult to eschew solid, evidential arguments that directly confront your claims.

Leuchter is no Chemist, his relevant background was in creating more consistent and effective electric chairs, lethal injection machines, and gallows
 for American prisons. It was later revealed, however, that Leuchter had no qualifications. He defends himself in "Mr. Death", which can be viewed <a href="https://archive.org/details/MrDeathFredA.Leuchter">here</a> by claiming that states hired him based on their assumptions about his abilities given he had produced Electric Chairs for the state of Tennesse. 
 Nevertheless, this did not make him a professional. As was later revealed, Leuchters machines were not as humane as he assured the people they were. 
 <br>
 <br>

 <blockquote>Suddenly, however, Mr. Leuchter, a 47-year-old self-taught death specialist, is out of favor with prison wardens and prosecutors. His wonderful machine, touted as a more humane way to kill killers, is now suspected of inflicting a little too much pain, even for fans of capital punishment.
First, Alabama's Attorney General questioned his expertise. Then Illinois, which recently performed its first execution in 28 years, terminated his consulting contract after a medical expert testified that his machine for injecting potassium cyanide would cause the prisoner unnecessary pain, consisting of a severe burning sensation. <a href="https://archive.vn/20120717063308/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html#selection-243.0-246.0 ">Source</a></blockquote>

<p> An important element of the Markiewics report is the history behind it. A polish group, led by Markiewics, went to Auschwitz to test the levels of Prussian Blue in 
	various places in the camp 
</p>
<br>
<body style="text-align: center;"> 
The gas chambers have blue staining, but not all of the walls of the delousing chambers
 were stained. It's because brick is not easily penetrated by cyanide ions, and the iron oxide in brick 
is not very reactive. The gas chambers were made of brick. In addition, the gas chambers
were destroyed by the Germans at the end of the war. Bunker 1 was in a red building, but
 inside the gas chambers the walls were painted white. The IFR team originally found cyanide in only one of 
the ruins, which Germar Rudolf proclaims to have confirmed Leutcher's results. 
However the IFR (Institute of Forensic Research) then returned for a closer inspection. 
"We tried to take samples -- if at all possible -- from the places best sheltered and least exposed to 
rainfall, including also as far as possible -- fragments of the upper parts of the chambers (hydrogen cyanide 
is lighter than air) and also of the concrete floors, with which the gas from the spilled Zyklon B came into 
contract at rather high concentrations. Samples, about 1-2 g in weight, were taken by chipping pieces from 
bricks and concrete or scrapping off, particularly in the case of plaster and also mortar. " Note the 
references to materials other than bricks found in the construction.
The IFR samples "unequivocally show that the cyanide compounds occur in all the facilities that, according to 
the source data, were in contact with them. On the other hand, they do not occur in dwelling accommodations, 
which was shown by means of control samples. The concentrations of cyanide compounds in the samples collected 
from one and the same room or building show great differences. This indicates that the conditions that favour 
the formation of stable compounds as a result of the reaction of hydrogen cyanide with the components of the
 walls, occur locally. In this connection it takes quite a large number of samples from a given facility to 
give us a chance to come upon this sort of local accumulation of cyanide compounds."
Rudolf tried to debunk this, but he was debunked himself when the IFR found samples in the ruins that were 
better protected, using a large number of samples and more sensitive tests. The IFR did not respond to Rudolf,
 but other expeters did. Critics force Rudolf to retreat from his previous claims of certainty. "[Critic] 
Green's second prerequisite is that I have to "demonstrate rigorously" "that the kinetics involved with the 
formation of such pigments dictate that significant quantities should be formed in all of the homicidal gas 
chambers". I stated before that this is nearly impossible. Consequently we must conclude that chemistry is not
 a science with the power to prove or refute human gassings in Auschwitz "rigorously"
Rudolf was then forced to back down from his claims of "Certainty"</p>

  <label for="collapsible-5" class="lbl-toggle">Status of David Irving as a respected historian by GENERALIST HISTORIANS/NON-SPECIALISTS</label>
  <div class="collapsible-content">
    <div class="content-inner">
<body>

Academic historians  with a general knowl- edge of modem history  had  indeed mostly been  quite  generous  to Irving,  even  where  they  had  found  reason  to  
criticize him or disagree  with his  views. Paul Addison, for  example, an expert  on British history in the Second World War, 
had  concluded  that while Irving was “usually a Colossus of research, he is often a schoolboy in judgment.”

Reviewing The 
War Path in 1978, R. Hinton Thornas, professor of German at Birmingham University, 
whose knowledge of the social and political context of twentieth-century German literature
was both deep and broad, dismissed the book as “unoriginal” and its “claims to novelty”  as “ill-based."

“Much of  Irving’s argument,”  wrote Sir Martin Gilbert, official biogra- pher of Churchill,  about Hitler’s War in 1977, “is based on speculation.” But he also praised the book as “a scholarly  work, the  fruit of a decade of wide researches.”

even reviewers who  had praised “the  depth of  Irving’s research and his intelligence” found  “too many avoidable mistakes . . . passages quoted without attribution and important  statements  not tagged to  the listed sources.”15 John Charmley, a right-wing historian at the University of East Anglia, wrote  that  he  “admires Mr.  Irving’s assiduity, energy,  and courage.” He continued:“  Mr. Irving’s sources, unlike the conclusions which he draws from them,  are usually sound.” But he also noted:  “Mr. Irv- ing is cited only when his sources have been  checked  and found reliable.”

<br> 
<strong>Historians with firsthand  research  experience  and  expertise in Irving’s field(Specialists) were  more criticaI still.</strong>
<br>
<br>

An early, prominent  instance of criti- cism from such a quarter  came with Hugh Trevor-Roper’s review of HitZerB War in 1977.  Trevor-Roper  had worked in British Intelligence during  the war  and  had  been  charged  with  heading an official  mission to find out  the  true facts about the  death of Hitler. The result ofh  is researches,  published in 1947 as The Last Day of Hider, immediately established him as a leading  authority on Nazi Germany  and especially onI  rving’s home  territory of Hitler  and his immediate  personal en- tourage. Reviewing Hitler’s War, Trevor-Roper paid the by now custom- ary tribute  to Irving’s ingenuitv  and  persistence as a researcher. “No praise,”  he  wrote,  “can  be  too high for his indefatigable scholarly indus- try.”  But  this was immediately followed by devastating criticism of Irv- ing’s method.  Trevor-Roper  continued: 
<br>
<br>

<blockquote>"When a historian  relies  nlainly  on  primary sources, which  we can- not  easily check, he challenges our confidence  and  forces us to ask critical questions. How  reliable is his historical method? How  sound is his judgment? We  ask these questions particularly of  any  man who,  like Mr. Irving,  makes a virtue-almost a profession-of  using arcane sources to affront established opinions"</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
 
 Irving’s work, he concluded,  had  a  “consistent  bias"
 <hr>
 <br>
<br>

 The same view  was taken by Martin Broszat. director of the lnstituf fiir Zeitgeschichte (Institute for  Contemporary  History) in Munich  when Ining published HitZer3 War. One of the world’s leading  historians of Nazi Germany, Broszat began his critique of Hitler’s War by casting  scorn on Irving’s much-vaunted list of archival discoveries. The evidence Irv- ing had  gathered from the reminiscences of Hitler’s entourage might pro- vide more exact detail of what  went  on at Hitler’s wartime  headquarters...but it did little to enlarge our knowledge  of the important nlilitaly and polit- ical decisions  that Hitler took, and so did not live up to the claims  Irving made for  it.  Broszat went much further, however, and included the allega- tion, backed up by detailed examples, that Irving had manipulated and mis- interpreted original documents in order to prove  his  arguments
<br>
<br>
 PARTICULARLY HARSH CRITICISM (lmfao this guy is a savage)
 <br>
<br>
 Equally critical  was the American Charles W. Sydnor  Jr., who at the time of  writing his  review had just completed a lengthy  study, Soldiers of Destruction: The SS Deathb Head Division, 1933-1945, published by Princeton University Press. Sydnor’s thirty-page  demolition of  Irving’s  book  was one of the few reviews  of  any  of  Irving’s  books  for  which the reviewer had manifestly undertaken a  substantial amount of  original research.’~ Sydnor considered Ilving‘s  boast to have outdone all other Hitler scholars in the depth  and thoroughness  of  his  research to be “pretentious twaddle.” He accused  Irving  of innumerable inaccuracies,  distortions,  manipulations, and mistranslations in  his treatment of the documents.” 
 <br>
<br>

 Peter Hoffnlann, the world’s leading authority  on the conservative resistance to  Hitler  and  the individuals and  groups  behind the  bomb plot of 20 July 1944, and a profound  student of the  German archival record of the wartime years, was equally critical of  Irving’s biography of Her- mann  Goring,  published in 1988:
 <br>
<br>

 <blockquote>Mr.  Irving’s constant  references  to  archives,  diaries and letters, and the overwhelming  amount of detail in his  work,  suggest  objectivity. In fact  they put up  a  screen  behind  which a very  different  agenda is transacted. . . . Mr.  Irving is a great  obfuscator. . . . Distortions  affect evely  important  aspect of this book to the point of obfuscation. . . . It is unfortunate that  Mr.  Irving  wastes  his  extraordinary  talents as a  researcher and writer  on  trivializing the greatest  crimes in Ger- man  history,  on  manipulating  historical  sources and on highlighting the theatrics of the Nazi era.</blockquote>
 <br>
<br>

 <strong>The "Smoking Gun Document" was no longer relevant</strong>
 <br>
<br>
 “usefully  provoked  historians by raising the question of the smoking gun” (whether an order could be found from Hitler to perpetrate a  holocaust against the Jews),  twenty-two  years on, so much research had  been carried out in this area by historians that  although he (Irving) repeated it  in Goring, “it is no  longer possible to  regard Mr.  Irving’s thesis as a useful provocation.”2
 <br>

 A few choice quotes from other highly-respected German/WW2 Specialist Historians
 <br>
<br>

 <b>John Lukacs </b>
 <br>
<br>

  “Mr Irving’s factual  errors  are  beyond  belief"
 on Hitler's War “many  errors in names  and dates;  more  important, unverifiable and unconvincing assertions  abound.”
  “without  dates, places, or file or page numbers.”  “Many of the archival references in  Irving’s footnotes . . . were inaccurate  and  did  not  prove or even  refer  to the  pertinent statements in Irving’s text.” “manipulations, attributinga  tl  east false meanings tos  omed  ocuments or, in other instances,  printing  references  to irrelevant ones.”  “a single docu- ment,  or  fragment of a document, was enough  for Irving to build a very questionable thesis on its contents or on the lack  of such.”   ‘While  some of Irving’s  ‘finds’ cannot  be  disregarded their  interpretation . . . is, more  often  than  not,  compromised  and  even badly  flawed"
  <br>
<br>

  <b> David Cannadine, currently  director of the  Institute of Historical  Research at London  University</b>
   On irvings method: “excesses, inconsistencies  and  omissions.” 
     “seems  completely  unaware of recent work done  on  the  subject"
     "It is not merely that the  arguments in  this book are so perversely  tendentious  and  irresponsibly sensationalist. It is  also that it is written  in  a  tone  which is at  best  casually journalistic  and  at worst quite exceptionally offensive. The text is littered with errors from beginning to end "
     <br>

  <div class="collapsible-content">
    <div class="content-inner">
 <blockquote> Already in the immediate  aftermath of the war,  Allied war  crimes prosecutors  had  sifted  through  tons of captured  German  documents  to prepare  their  indictments  in  the  Nuremberg Trials. Many  of these  had been  printed in the published  record of the trials. The eventual return of the original documents, many times  more voluminous than  the  printed selection,  to the  German  Federal Archives, had  provided the stimulus  for a massive new  research  effort,  spearheaded by Munich’s Znstitutfiir Zit- geschichte (Institute for  Contemporary  History).  Since then, vast new masses of documents,b  oth official andp  rivatei  np  rovenance,h  ad become available to scholars in a variety of public  state archives in Ger- many and other countries.  This was not an area of history  like, say, the fifth century,  when  historians  had  to make do  with  sparse  and  obscure source  material  to  reconstruct what happened. Historians of the  Third Reich and  the Second World War were  more in danger of drowning in a sea of sources. </blockquote>
   <br>
<br>
 <blockquote> From the 1960s onwards,  generations of Ph.D. students  from many countries  had  descended  upon the  German archives and the microfilmed editions of captured  German  documents available in the National Archives in WashingtonD,  .C., the Imperial War Museum,  and  elsewhere,  and  produced  a mass of published  research  into the history of Germany under Nazism and  during  the  Second World War that, four  decades  later, was almost overwhelming. The  techniques of documentary investigation in which Irving  presented himself as the mas- ter  were in fact a  normal  part of the stock-in-trade of every  trainee  pro- fessional historian. Of course,  Irving  had  discovered new documents  and obtained new evidence,  for  example, by interviewing surviving eyewit- nesses of the  time. But this was true of a vast number of other historians too. The difference was that  professional  historians did not make such a fetish of it</blockquote>
   <br>
<br>
 <blockquote>Historians also had to rely on  each other’s work. There was nothing wrong with this,  where the work relied  on  conformed to  the  accepted canons of scholarly research  and  rested  on  thorough,  transparent,  and unbiased investigation of the primary  sources. So vast  was the material with which historians  dealt, so numerous  were the subjects  they  covered, so consuming of time,  energy,  and financial resources was the whole process of historical research,  that it would be  completely  impossible  for new historical discoveries  and  insights  to be  generated if every  historian had  to go back to the original sources for everything he or  she  wanted  to say. This  need  to rely on  each  other’s work had  nothing  to do with  copy- ing or plagiarism: on  the contrary, the conventions of scholarship ensured that  footnotes  and other references  were  used in scholarly historical work to  pinpoint  precisely  where the historian  had  obtained  information,  and to allow the  reader to  check up on  this if so desired. </blockquote>

  <div class="collapsible-content">
    <div class="content-inner">

 Deborah Lipstadt, a Jewish Historian, had written a criticism of Irving. Irving filed suit against he claiming libel and great damage to his wellbeing and career. He wanted Lipstadts book pulled, and to be compensated. There was no suit filed AGAINST IRVING. IRVING FILED SUIT AGAINST LIPSTADT. THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO SILENCE IRVING BY ANY PARTY. Irvings own books far outsold the book Lipstadt had criticized him in, in any case. 
   <br>
<br>
 In british courts, the accused must prove that they are innocent, there is no obligation for the plaintiff to prove the guilt of the defense. This is the inverse of american courts, where innocence is presumed and freedom of speech is emphasized. 
   <br>
<br>
 With the court presuming the claims in question were lies until proven otherwise, the defense(Recall in this case the defense is Lipstadt NOT Irving) had an incredible amount of work to do in order to, essentially, prove to a Judge that the holocaust did infact happen, and that all of Lipstadts claims about Irving were true. The defenses approach was the following
    <br>
<br>
 <blockquote>. The strategy  that  Julius  and his team,  backed by Penguin’s solicitors Davenport Lyons, unfolded was three-pronged. First,  it involved commissioning professional historians to  provide  expert reports  to the court  presenting the evidence for the gassing facilities at Auschwitz, for the mass murder itself, for the existence of a  co-ordinated Nazi  policy to  exterminate the Jews, and for the involvement of Hitler in this  operation</blockquote>

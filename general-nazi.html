<strong>Germar Rudolf Chemical reports</strong>
<body> BLUE STAINS: The gas chambers have blue staining, but not all of the walls of the delousing chambers
 were stained. It's because brick is not easily penetrated by cyanide ions, and the iron oxide in brick 
is not very reactive. The gas chambers were made of brick. In addition, the gas chambers
were destroyed by the Germans at the end of the war. Bunker 1 was in a red building, but
 inside the gas chambers the walls were painted white. The IFR team originally found cyanide in only one of 
the ruins, which Germar Rudolf proclaims to have confirmed Leutcher's results. 
However the IFR (Institute of Forensic Research) then returned for a closer inspection. 
"We tried to take samples -- if at all possible -- from the places best sheltered and least exposed to 
rainfall, including also as far as possible -- fragments of the upper parts of the chambers (hydrogen cyanide 
is lighter than air) and also of the concrete floors, with which the gas from the spilled Zyklon B came into 
contract at rather high concentrations. Samples, about 1-2 g in weight, were taken by chipping pieces from 
bricks and concrete or scrapping off, particularly in the case of plaster and also mortar. " Note the 
references to materials other than bricks found in the construction.
The IFR samples "unequivocally show that the cyanide compounds occur in all the facilities that, according to 
the source data, were in contact with them. On the other hand, they do not occur in dwelling accommodations, 
which was shown by means of control samples. The concentrations of cyanide compounds in the samples collected 
from one and the same room or building show great differences. This indicates that the conditions that favour 
the formation of stable compounds as a result of the reaction of hydrogen cyanide with the components of the
 walls, occur locally. In this connection it takes quite a large number of samples from a given facility to 
give us a chance to come upon this sort of local accumulation of cyanide compounds."
Rudolf tried to debunk this, but he was debunked himself when the IFR found samples in the ruins that were 
better protected, using a large number of samples and more sensitive tests. The IFR did not respond to Rudolf,
 but other expeters did. Critics force Rudolf to retreat from his previous claims of certainty. "[Critic] 
Green's second prerequisite is that I have to "demonstrate rigorously" "that the kinetics involved with the 
formation of such pigments dictate that significant quantities should be formed in all of the homicidal gas 
chambers". I stated before that this is nearly impossible. Consequently we must conclude that chemistry is not
 a science with the power to prove or refute human gassings in Auschwitz "rigorously"
Rudolf was then forced to back down from his claims of "Certainty"

<strong>Wooden Doors</strong>
<body>WOODEN DOORS: Most Wooden Doors were destroyed in retreating SS or advancing Russians. The SS and Camp guards
turned the gas chambers into makeshift air raid shelters when the russians came nearer, the doors were replaced
so that they could be opened by the inside.

<strong>Evidence of Gassings</strong>
<b>Chemical discoveries at Kanada I Warehouses</b>
<p> The Kanda Warehouses (Effektenlager, or Kanda) stored the belongings of camp inmates, as upon arrival they would be stripped, their belongings would be taken, and ther hair would shaved. The German government would claim their belonging and store them in the Kanda Warehouses before shipping them out. Among the belongs, womens hair was taken. 
	<blockquote>According to a February 6, 1943 report from Auschwitz and Majdanek, 824 freight cars of clothing and footwear and a freight car of women's hair was shipped for certain offices. Published by Strzelecki 2000b, pp. 158-159. For the values looted in Auschwitz see Kádár-Vági 2005, pp. 208-214.</blockquote>
Fortunately, Hair was collected from the Kanda I site (not a trivial amount of hair, either. 25.5kg/56.2 lbs) and tested for the presence of Cyanide, a chemical that would be present after exposure to Zyklon B. The victims would have been shaved after death. The bag of hair was accepted as evidence in Irving v. Penguin Publishing Ltd. and Deborah Lipstadt, which should satisfy any evidential requirements.

It is also prudent to remind the reader that while Kanda II was destroyed during the evacuation of Auschwitz, Kanada I was not.
